<h2>Message Man</h2>
<p>
No no no no no no<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
</p>
<p>
The loser hides behind<br>
A mask of my disguise<br>
And who I am today<br>
Is worse than other times<br>
You don't know what I've done<br>
I'm wanted and on the run<br>
I'm wanted and on the run<br>
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future<br>
</p>
<p>
Release me from the present<br>
I'm obsessing, all these questions<br>
Why I'm in denial<br>
That they tried this suicidal session<br>
Please use discretion<br>
When you're messing with the message man<br>
These lyrics aren't for everyone<br>
Only few understand<br>
</p>
<p>
No no no no no no<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
</p>
<p>
You don't know my brain<br>
The way you know my name<br>
You don't know my heart<br>
The way you know my face<br>
You don't know what I've done<br>
I'm wanted and on the run<br>
I'm wanted and on the run<br>
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future<br>
</p>

Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?<br>
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this<br>
They rip it, flip it but these are just triplets<br>
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line<br>
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy<br>
Who takes every moment, he knows he can fight it<br>
And music to use it, for others to use it<br>
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?<br>
</p>
<p>
Life is up here but you comment below<br>
When the comments will always become common motivation<br>
To promote you choose next episode<br>
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope<br>
Is far from this moment but you would not know it<br>
Gets better when morning finally rears its head<br>
Together we'll lose this, remember the future<br>
Remember that morning is when night is dead<br>
</p>
<p>
Release me from the present<br>
I'm obsessing, all these questions<br>
Why I'm in denial<br>
That they tried this suicidal session<br>
Please use discretion<br>

<h2>Heavydirtysoul</h2>
<p>
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination<br>
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement<br>
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop<br>
Just another attempt to make the voices stop<br>
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something<br>
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing<br>
This doesn't mean I lost my dream<br>
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean<br>
</p>
<p>
Gangsters don't cry<br>
Therefore, therefore I'm<br>
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm<br>
</p>
<p>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
</p>
<p>
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said<br>
If I didn't know better I'd guess you're all already dead<br>
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch<br>
Saying stuff like, "You only live once"<br>
You've got one time to figure it out<br>
One time to twist, and one time to shout<br>
One time to think and I say we start now<br>
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talking about<br>
</p>
<p>
Gangsters don't cry<br>
Therefore, therefore I'm<br>
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm<br>
</p>
<p>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
</p>
<p>
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit<br>
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit<br>
</p>
<p>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
Can you save, can you save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
For me, for me, uh<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
</p>
<p>
Can you save, can you save my, save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>
Can you save, can you save my, save my<br>
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?<br>

<h2>Ode to Sleep</h2>
<p>
I wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time I find it handy<br>
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing<br>
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling<br>
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding<br>
I'm pleading, "Please, oh please" on my knees repeatedly asking<br>
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?<br>
I don't wanna be the one, be the one to has the<br>
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon<br>
Take this weapon, forged in darkness<br>
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon<br>
</p>
<p>
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight<br>
Why am I not scared in the morning?<br>
I don't hear those voices calling<br>
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out<br>
I swear I heard demons yelling<br>
Those crazy words they were spelling<br>
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone<br>
</p>
<p>
But I'll tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?<br>
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"<br>
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
I'll tell 'em<br>
</p>
<p>
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake<br>
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate<br>
The start of a day when we put on our face<br>
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace<br>
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us<br>
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must<br>
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead<br>
Desperately yelling, "There's something we need"<br>
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times<br>
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime<br>
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards<br>
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four<br>
</p>
<p>
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
Why am I not scared in the morning?<br>
I don't hear those voices calling<br>
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out<br>
I swear I heard demons yelling<br>
Those crazy words they were spelling<br>
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone<br>
</p>
<p>
But I'll tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go?<br>
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"<br>
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
</p>
<p>
I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em<br>
I'll tell 'em, please tell 'em, you have no plans for me<br>
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?<br>
I'm sorry<br>
